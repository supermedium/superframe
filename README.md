## Local Installation

Go to the folder of the component or scene you wish to develop and check out
its README. The steps generally involve:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:supermedium/superframe && cd superframe
# Head to the folder to develop (e.g., `cd components/foo`, `cd scenes/foo`).
npm install
npm run dev  # (or sometimes `npm run start`)
```

A page should open in your browser. You can develop on the source code and the
server will handle live compilation and bundling.
